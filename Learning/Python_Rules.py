# ? The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# ? Try running "import this" inside a Python interpreter

# ! Beautiful is better than ugly.
# ! Explicit is better than implicit.
# ! Simple is better than complex.
# ! Complex is better than complicated.
# ! Flat is better than nested.
# ! Sparse is better than dense.
# ! Readability counts.
# ! Special cases aren't 't special enough to break the rules.
# ! Although practicality beats purity.
# ! Errors should never pass silently.
# ! Unless explicitly silenced.
# ! In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# ! There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# ! This is a sample Python script.
# ! Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# ! Now is better than never.
# ! Although never is often better than *right* now.
# ! If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# ! If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# ! Namespaces are one honking great idea -- Let's do more of those!

# Press Shift+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code.
# Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.


def print_hi(name):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(f'Hi, {name}')  # Press Ctrl+F8 to toggle the breakpoint.


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_hi('Divine Jude')
